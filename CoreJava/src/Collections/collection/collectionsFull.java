    1. What is Collections
        Ans) Collections are a framework(setup) provided by java. This framework provides many interfaces and their
             implemented classes in order to store the multiple elements in a single entity(like arrays).
           In arrays(static) we will store one type of data to a fixed length, collections we can store
           multiple type of values like(key,value) and no need  to specify size it changes dynamically.
    2. Interfaces provided by Collections framework.
        Ans) Collections means framework and collection means interface.
           Collections gives two interfaces
                a)Collection Interface(3 interfaces) :
                    1.Lists Interface:    ArraysList,LinkedList,Vector,Stack(all are classes)
                    2.Set Interface:      HashSet,LinkedHashSet,TreeSet(all are classes)
                    3.Queue Interface:    ArrayQueue,PriorityQueue(all are classes)
                b)Map Interface:  HashTable,HashMap,LinkedHashMap,TreeMap(all are classes)
                * We also have Collections class which consist of common operations to perform for above interfaces like sorting,filtering etc.
    3. Classes provided by Collections framework
        Ans) refer thr core java file in finder
    4. Hierarchy of Collection Interface
        Ans) refer thr core java file in finder
    5. Hierarchy of Class Interface
        Ans) refer thr core java file in finder
