    1. What is a List
        Ans) List is a interface which implements collection interface.
    2. Hierarchy of List Interface in java
        Ans) refer thr core java file in finder
    3. Implementation of ArrayList and Vector
        Ans) These two are same like arrays fixed size if extra size is required then new one will be created with a
             100% previous size then it is called VECTOR ,and increase 50% size then previous called ARRAYLIST
             and  after shifting previous one will be destroyed
    4. How to use ArrayList
    5.Important points to remember to every collection
        a) What is default capacity
        b) What is the initial capacity
        c) Does it allow duplicate elements
        d) Does it allow null elements
        e) Does it maintain the insertion order
        f) Does it maintained the sorted order
        g) Does it offer hte random access to elements
        h) Is it synchronised
        i) What is it good at
    6. Major operations list(not only list operations these are also used by all Interfaces above here)
        * Creation of list
        * Addition of elements into list
        * Retrieval of elements from list
        * Deletion of elements from list
        * Verification of elements in the list
        * Updation of elements in the list
* Linked list is not only implements list interface and also deque interface which implements by Queue.
